# Question Stem
You are given an m x n binary matrix matrix.

You can choose any number of columns in the matrix and flip every cell in that column (i.e., Change the value of the cell from 0 to 1 or [[vice]] [[versa]]).

Return the maximum number of rows that have all values equal after some number of flips.






# Test Case
## **Example 1:**
Input: matrix = \[\[0,1\],\[1,1\]\]
Output: 1
Explanation: After flipping no values, 1 row has all values equal.


## **Example 2:**
Input: matrix = \[\[0,1\],\[1,0\]\]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the first column, both rows have equal values.

## **Example 3:**
Input: matrix = \[\[0,0,0\],\[0,0,1\],\[1,1,0\]\]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the first two columns, the last two rows have equal values.
# Constraints:
m == matrix.length
n == matrix\[i\].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
matrix\[i\]\[j\] is eitherÂ 0 or 1.


# Process of Reflection
>I find myself **at an [[impasse]]**, lacking [[viable]] approaches to tackle the question at hand. It is evident that seeking guidance from others' insights is a [[prudent]] course of action.
>After [[perusing]] the method [[proposed]] for resolving this [[perplexing]] question, I [[swiftly]] grasped its underlying brilliance. It becomes apparent that the essence of the two rows in the matrix is **identical**, differing [[solely]] in the two **distinct** modes to their existence. Consequently, we can **opt** to preserve one mode while flipping the other. **Ultimately**, by **utilizing** a hash table to track the numbers and returning the maximum value, a solution can be achieved.
